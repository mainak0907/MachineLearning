## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input features. In this repository, you'll find an implementation of linear regression using Python and various tools and libraries.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a widely used algorithm for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of an input belonging to a particular class. Explore the logistic regression implementation in this repository, including code examples and practical applications.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in any data science project. It involves analyzing and visualizing the data to gain insights and uncover patterns. This repository provides resources and examples for performing EDA using popular Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It finds an optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes. Discover the SVM implementation in this repository, along with practical examples and applications.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving most of the original information. Dive into the PCA implementation in this repository, including code snippets and visualization techniques.

## Decision Tree

Decision trees are versatile machine learning models that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They make predictions by recursively partitioning the input space based on the feature values. Explore the decision tree implementation in this repository, including tree visualization and interpretation techniques.

## Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes

Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a given piece of text. Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm for sentiment analysis tasks. Discover the implementation of sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes in this repository, along with datasets and code examples.

## Perceptrons

Perceptrons are the building blocks of neural networks. They are binary classifiers that can learn to make predictions by adjusting their weights based on input features. Explore the implementation of perceptrons in this repository, along with examples and resources for understanding neural networks.
